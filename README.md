A coreset is a small weighted subset that approximates the loss function on the whole data, prevalent in machine learning for its advantages. However, current construction methods are problem-dependent and may be challenging for new researchers.

No worries, we got you. We propose "*AutoCoreset*": an automatic practical framework for constructing coresets requiring only input data and the cost function (without any other user computation or calculation), making it user-friendly and applicable to various problems. See our open-source code which supports future research and simplifies coreset usage.
